## Setup

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd('C:/Users/Silvy/Documents/R/Repos/Project3WeatherPatterns')
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)


```

## GLMM

```{r}
#GLMM

```
